# The Evolution of Representational Structures Regarding Perception and Suitability

In his Origin of Species, Charles Darwin summarizes his theory that in nature, living beings compete with each other for survival. Through natural selection, more fit individuals are more likely to inherit their genes. With the help of evolutionary game theory, we can study this process: is it enough to see/perceive what is needed
for survival or do need more information to do so? Are fitness-based organisms better at surviving than those tuned to the objective truth? The nature of reality
has been the subject of many scholarly debates and dialogues for millennia: the study of being (ontology) and the nature of knowledge (epistemology) have grown
into philosophical disciplines. In his research on cognitive science, Donald Hoffman concluded that reality - independent of us - is far from what we think it is. Moreover, it is due to evolution itself that we have changed our perception of objective reality to the fitness-based truth. If they do not coincide, natural selection will favor living beings that are attuned to fitness and not to reality. The dissertation examines these conclusions with simulations performed with different types of representation structures.
